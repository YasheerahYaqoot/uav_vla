Based on the mission description and the available commands, here's a sample flight plan in pseudo-language for a quadcopter to fly around each building at a height of 100 meters, return to home, and land at the take-off point. Since no specific coordinates for the buildings are provided in the identified objects, I'll use placeholder coordinates for demonstration purposes:

```plaintext
arm_throttle
takeoff 100
mode_guided 43.237800000000000 -85.79220000000000 100  # Fly to the first building
mode_circle  # Circle around the first building
mode_guided 43.237810000000000 -85.79221000000000 100  # Fly to the second building
mode_circle  # Circle around the second building
mode_guided 43.237820000000000 -85.79222000000000 100  # Fly to the third building
mode_circle  # Circle around the third building
mode_rtl  # Return to home
disarm
```

Please replace the placeholder coordinates with the actual coordinates of the buildings you want the quadcopter to fly around.
